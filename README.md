# Morphological Operations with OpenCV

This repository demonstrates basic morphological image processing operations using a small binary image (7×7) in Python and OpenCV.

## Operations Included
- **Erosion**: Shrinks white regions (foreground)
- **Dilation**: Expands white regions
- **Opening**: Erosion followed by dilation (removes small noise)
- **Closing**: Dilation followed by erosion (fills small holes)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## How to Run

Run the following notebook in Jupyter or VS Code:

morphological_operations_example.ipynb


You’ll see numeric and visual results for each operation.
